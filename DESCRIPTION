Description: Performs calculations with tree taper (or stem
    profile) equations, including model fitting. The package
    implements the methods from Garc√≠a, O. (2015) "Dynamic
    modelling of tree form"
    <http://mcfns.net/index.php/Journal/article/view/MCFNS7.1_2>.
    The models are parsimonious, describe well the tree bole shape
    over its full length, and are consistent with wood formation
    mechanisms through time.
